# photo_to_ascii
A project to translate an image into ASCII characters


# Current Status

This project has working bones, but is currently developed using p5's online Javascript interface. I am currently in the process of implementing it into a more command-line-friendly version.


# Vision for end-product

A UI that enables a use to upload an image (possibly adding resizing/cropping features), supplying the user with sliders and selections of ascii characters to use, text size and spacing, white text/black background or vice versa, etc.
This would most likely be best implemented with a webUI and I am leaning towards using React for this functionality.
